                <h3>The Telephoto Zoom – Fujifilm Fujinon XF 50-140mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR</h3>

            <div class="bscal-col">
                <p>A photographer on the move needs to control things quickly and easily.

This lens allows the photographer to control all the four elements with their left hand, leaving no room for uncertainty. This workhorse of a lens brings out the maximum potential of the camera and the photographer.</p>
